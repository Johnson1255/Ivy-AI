# Ivy AI
## About Ivy AI 🤖
Ivy AI is a project I've wanted to bring to life for a long time. It’s designed as a personal assistant with various functionalities, but beyond that, it's a platform where I can practice and improve my skills as a developer. 💻

This project serves as a sandbox to test different knowledge areas and tackle new challenges. I’m using it to experiment with concepts like AI, software design, and optimization, while also taking advantage of version control tools like Git. Working with branches, handling multiple deployments, and collaborating are all part of the learning process.

Ivy AI is a space for growth and experimentation, where I get to push my boundaries as a developer.
